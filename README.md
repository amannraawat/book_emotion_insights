## About The Project
In our sentiment analysis project, we first segmented the text into chapters and identified sentences containing happy and sad words using the NLTK library. We then conducted a frequency analysis to determine the most common words across the entire book. Using NLTK's sentiment analysis module, we calculated polarity scores for each chapter, providing insights into the emotional trajectory of the narrative.
